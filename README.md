# Covid Slot Vacancy App

Covid Slot Vacancy App is a full stack Flutter application developed and designed by Vansika Singh.

The application will fetch data from open source APIs and display all the necessary details for the available slots like the Center ID, Center Name, Center Address, Vaccine Name, and the timings of the slots avaliable on that day.
